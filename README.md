### 📊 Results & Interpretation
<br>
The dataset revealed clear customer patterns based on annual income and spending score. Clusters represented groups such as:
<br>

● High income, high spending (ideal target for premium products)

● Low income, high spending (potentially at-risk segment)

● Average income, low spending (opportunity for engagement strategies)

These insights help businesses tailor offerings, predict churn, and drive personalized engagement.
